# Motivation
In this notebook I used the goods vehicle kilometers data from 2001 to 2018 to answer the following questions: 

- What are the types of common goods vehicle? How can we tell them apart using data? 
- What is the lifespan of a goods vehicle? 
- Why is there such high volume of goods vehicle on the motorways nowadays?
