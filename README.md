# Goods vehicle analysis
In this notebook I use the goods vehicle kilometers data from 2001 to 2018 to answer the following questions I have on road freight transport. 

- What are the types of goods vehicle? How to tell them from each other using the data? 
- What is the average age of goods vehicle? 
- Why is there such high volume of goods vehicle on the motorways nowadays?
